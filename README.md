**Problem Statement: Building an Automated Homemade Food Delivery Platform**

In today's fast-paced world, people are seeking convenient ways to enjoy homemade and local dishes without the hassle of cooking. Additionally, skilled home cooks often have the opportunity to share their culinary talents with a wider audience. However, there is a lack of efficient systems that bridge the gap between home cooks and customers, leading to missed opportunities and time-consuming processes.

Our challenge is to create an innovative and user-friendly platform that automates the process of preparing and delivering homemade dishes from local cooks to eager customers. This platform will serve as a one-stop solution for customers seeking authentic homemade meals and for home cooks looking to expand their reach while ensuring the highest level of quality and convenience.
